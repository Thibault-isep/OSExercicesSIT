OS exercices for SIT semester - Thibault CHANIER

ex6-1 problems:
- The script is fixed on a loop with 5 iterations
- The command is filled with messages at each iteration of the loop
- the last iteration of the loop has an unnecessary pause

ex6-2 additions:
- We ask the user the number of times the files must be backed up (= number of iterations of the loop)
- We add the operation messages of the loop in the log file instead of displaying them in the command
- We add a condition in the last iteration of the loop to remove the last pause
